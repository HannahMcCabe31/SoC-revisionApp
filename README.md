# SoC-revisionApp

During our project week, my team (AsyncAvatars) was assigned the task of creating a comprehensive full-stack application targeting a specific challenge encountered by participants in the School of Code bootcamp. The primary objective was to enhance the overall experience of our fellow bootcampers, emphasizing aspects like remote learning, knowledge retention, and fostering collaboration.

As a cohesive team, we opted to address a prevalent issue among bootcamp participants: imposter syndrome, a challenge experienced by almost every individual at some point over the course. Given the School of Code's mission to empower anyone to enter the tech industry, our diverse backgrounds and many members' lack of prior coding experience were key considerations. Learning coding from scratch at an accelerated pace while transitioning into an entirely new career path can be overwhelmingly daunting, often leading to doubts about our suitability for a tech career.

I've decided to continue developing this app in order to hone my skills as a full stack developer. My future plans include adding a profile page, a login page and continuing to refine the design and user experience.
