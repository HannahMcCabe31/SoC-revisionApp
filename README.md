# SoC-revisionApp

During our project week, our team (AsyncAvatars) was assigned the task of creating a comprehensive full-stack application targeting a specific challenge encountered by participants in the School of Code bootcamp. The primary objective was to enhance the overall experience of our fellow bootcampers, emphasizing aspects like remote learning, knowledge retention, and fostering collaboration.

As a cohesive team, we opted to address a prevalent issue among bootcamp participants: imposter syndrome, a challenge experienced by almost every individual at some point over the course. Given the School of Code's mission to empower anyone to enter the tech industry, our diverse backgrounds and many members' lack of prior coding experience were key considerations. Learning coding from scratch at an accelerated pace while transitioning into an entirely new career path can be overwhelmingly daunting, often leading to doubts about our suitability for a tech career.

Initially, we contemplated offering positive affirmations and emotional support to alleviate this issue. However, upon conducting thorough user research, we discovered that consolidating all course resources into a centralised resource would be more effective in empowering bootcampers to feel more in control of their learning journey and consequently feel less like an imposter.

I really enjoyed collaborating with such an exceptional team that showcased remarkable communication and teamwork skills, fostering an environment where we successfully honed various concepts acquired during the bootcamp. Our project encompassed diverse elements such as UX/UI design, Agile methodologies, and the development of a front-end application (HTML, CSS, JS) interfacing with a backend application (Node.js). Ensuring data transfer between the front and backend, our application includes testing to guarantee its functionality.

I have decided to continue developing our app, and have plans to refine the design and layout, incorporate a log in page and add more helpful links to the database.
